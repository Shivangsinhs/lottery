Q)Design and implement a simple lottery game. Generate three random integer numbers between
1 and 59, and use the prompt() function to accept the user’s input of three numbers. It should
then behave as follows:

● If all the numbers are matched (the sequence does not matter in this game), then generate
a message using alert(): “Congratulations, you win the first prize!”.
● If two of the three numbers are matched, then generate a message: “You win the second
prize!”.
● If one of the three numbers is matched, then generate a message: “You win the third
prize!”.
● If none of the numbers are matched, then generate a message: “Sorry, you didn’t win this
time!”.
● If the numbers match and are in the correct order, generate the message: “You win the
jackpot!”.
Think carefully about how to test this. How will you know that all of the above cases work
correctly?
As an extension: ensure that the three generated random numbers are all different
